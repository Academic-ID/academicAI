    "## How this works\n",
    "\n",
    "For **docx (Word)** and **PDF** files, this code will first find pages that\n",
    "match the keywords that you define in the `keywords` array.\n",
    "\n",
    "It will then send these pages to the LLM to determine if the page is relevant to\n",
    "the task you have set, and if it is, it will summarise the page.\n",
    "\n",
    "For all relevent pages, these are recorded in a spreadsheet in the results\n",
    "folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three inputs required to make this work. If this is a fresh install,\n",
    "there example below gives a good outline of what to include (this can always be\n",
    "found back at the [Github repo](https://github.com/Academic-ID/academicAI)).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You need to provide a list of **keywords** in the cell below to search for in\n",
    "   the documents. This can be any number of keywords and should look like the\n",
    "   following: `keywords = ['regulation', 'regulatory']`. This stage is akin to\n",
    "   doing a Ctr+F over a document. You should first ensure PDF documents have\n",
    "   readable text. This code doesn't at this stage provide an OCR functionality\n",
    "   so if documents do not have searchable text, this code will miss them\n",
    "   entirely (to check, open the file and see if you can select text as you would\n",
    "   to copy and paste it).\n",
    "2. You need to detail the **task** that the AI assistant is carrying out. It is\n",
    "   vital that you are extremely explicit in your instructions. The more detailed\n",
    "   you are, the better the summaries you will receive and the lower the\n",
    "   liklihood that something relevant is missed.\n",
    "3. To speed things up, pages are processed in parallel. How many pages are being\n",
    "   processed at one time is set by the **max_workers** variable. There are two\n",
    "   things you need to consider when setting this. First, your machine's\n",
    "   resources (e.g. available threads), and second (and likely more of a concern)\n",
    "   the rate limiting of requests to the LLM. It is worth playing around with\n",
    "   this value starting from higher to lower and reducing the number until errors\n",
    "   stop appearing. Between 5 and 10 seems a fairly safe bet just using the API\n",
    "   with no additional rate limit increases.\n"

    "- I am interested in how the company complies with its regulatory obligations as a telecommunications provider in Australia. This includes any information on how TPG ensures it complies with the law, industry codes, and any other telecommunications-focused regulatory obligations. \n",
    "- This is only in relation to regulations specific to the telecommunications industry. Do not include anything relating to companies regulations (e.g. Australian consumer law, tax law, stock exchange or other non-telecommunications related regulation).\n",

    "- Please do not copy and paste the information you have found. I want you to read the information carefully, understand it, and then summarise it in your own words. However, the only caveat to this is to ensure to maintain language with specific meaning to regulation or law. For example, words such as 'comply', 'presumption' or 'regulation' should be maintained.\n",

Do not speculate or try to summarise what you think the approach is. Only summarise what is provided in the text. For example, do not write something along the lines of: 'this demonstrates a robust approach to compliance'. Instead, write something like: 'TPG's compliance approach includes...'.\n",
    "- Do not include marketspeech (adjectives or adverbs TPG has used to describe their approaches in more positive terms) - just provide a plain english recount of their compliance approach as documented in the text.\n",
    "- Do not make reference to the text by saying 'the provided text' or anything like that. Do not use phrases such as 'This text' or 'This document' to start your summary and/or introduce the text. Just recount what is in the provided text.\n",
